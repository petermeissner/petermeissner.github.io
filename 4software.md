R6 Objects for Text and Data

For natural language processing and analysis of qualitative text coding structures which provide a way to bind together text and text data are fundamental. The package provides such a structure and accompanying methods in form of R6 objects. The 'rtext' class allows for text handling and text coding (character or regex based) including data updates on text transformations as well as aggregation on various levels. Furthermore, the usage of R6 enables inheritance and passing by reference which should enable 'rtext' instances to be used as back-end for R based graphical text editors or text coding GUIs.

This software was created as part of the "Institutional Design in Western European Democracies" research project, funded by DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), lead by Ulrich Sieberer and based at University Konstanz.

Convenient Base R String Handling

Base R already ships with string handling capabilities 'out-of-the-box' but lacks streamlined function names and workflow. The 'stringi' ('stringr') package on the other hand has well named functions, extensive Unicode support and allows for a streamlined workflow. On the other hand it adds dependencies and regular expression interpretation between base R functions and 'stringi' functions might differ. This packages aims at providing a solution to the use case of unwanted dependencies on the one hand but the need for streamlined text processing on the other. The packages' functions are solely based on wrapping base R functions into 'stringr'/'stringi' like function names. Along the way it adds one or two extra functions and last but not least provides all functions as generics, therefore allowing for adding methods for other text structures besides plain character vectors.

[[Package source at Github]](https://github.com/petermeissner/unikonstanzmensabot)

This sturdy little fellow -- called Mampf-Bot or Mampfy by his friends -- daily moves out to do his tasks. First, Mampfy fetches fresh  menus from the University of Konstanz Canteen. Thereafter, Mampfy boils his gatherings into a soup until he has a nice extract in tabular form which he then serves in little pieces laid out on Twitter. As Bot-O-Cuisine Mampfy of cause prefers to use a Pi as his vehicle. When Mampfy is grown up he would like to inform its users about the general popularity of different dishes and make predictions about line/queue speed.

Mampfy's guts lie open on [Github](https://github.com/petermeissner/unikonstanzmensabot) and his gallery of wisdom shines on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mensa_Bot_UniKN/with_replies). He talks about the [University of Konstanz](http://www.uni-konstanz.de/) and its [canteen's menu](https://www.seezeit.com/Essen/Speiseplaene/MensaGiessberg.html) which he never tries because he is bot. Mampfy's direct rival is called [Mensa Uni Konstanz](https://twitter.com/giessberg) who he does not like much because she does follow back although they are colleagues.

# <img src="/images/hellno50.png" style="width: 50px; vertical-align:middle;" /> hellno

[[Package source at Github]](https://github.com/petermeissner/hellno) / [[CRAN page]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hellno/index.html)

Base R's `stringsAsFactors` default setting is supposedly the 
  most often complained about piece of code in the whole R infrastructure. 
  A search through the source code of all CRAN packages in December 2015 ([Link](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Acran+stringsAsFactors&type=Code))
  resulted in 3,492 mentions of `stringsAsFactors`. Most of the time these explicit 
  mentions where found within calls to `data.frame()` or `as.data.frame()` and 
  simply set the value to `FALSE`. 
  
  The hellno package provides an explicit solution to the problem without 
  changing R itself or having to mess around with options. One could use e.g.:
  `options("stringsAsFactors" = FALSE)` to re-set the global default behavior. 
  Instead hellno tackles the problem from another direction, namely by 
  providing alternative implementations of `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()`. 
  Those *re*-implementations are in fact simple wrappers around base R's very own 
  `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` with `stringAsFactors` option set to 
  `HELLNO` - which in turn equals to `FALSE` and gives the package its name.
