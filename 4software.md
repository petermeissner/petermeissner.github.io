This sturdy little fellow -- called Mampf-Bot or Mampfy by his friends -- daily moves out to do his tasks. First, Mampfy fetches fresh  menus from the University of Konstanz Canteen. Thereafter, Mampfy boils his gatherings into a soup until he has a nice extract in tabular form which he then serves in little pieces laid out on Twitter. As Bot-O-Cuisine Mampfy of-cause prefers to use a Pi as his vehicle. When Mampfy is grown up he would like to inform its users about the general popularity of different dishes and make predictions about line/queue speed.

Mampfy's guts lie open on [Github](https://github.com/petermeissner/unikonstanzmensabot) and his gallery of wisdom shines on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mensa_Bot_UniKN/with_replies). He talks about the [University of Konstanz](http://www.uni-konstanz.de/) which he really likes a lot and its [canteen's menu](https://www.seezeit.com/Essen/Speiseplaene/MensaGiessberg.html) which he sometimes likes and sometimes not - but in the end never tries anyways, because he is bot and not some hungry human. Mampfy's direct rival is called [Mensa Uni Konstanz](https://twitter.com/giessberg) who he does not like much because she does not have the courtesy to follow back - although they are colleagues and he does follow her.
