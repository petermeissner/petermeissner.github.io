# About Me

Hallo, I am Peter Meißner, data enthusiast, R-lover, dog walker, toddler chaser. <br>
I live and work in Konstanz, Germany.

For a living I gather data, make it behave, model it and take care that its secrets appeal to the observers eyes. My tool set is heavily R-centric but involves everything that comes handy in getting the job done.
