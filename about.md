# About Me

Hallo, I am Peter Meißner. I am data enthusiast, R-lover, dog walker and toddler chaser. I started sports with swimming, jumped on Basketball, got hooked on climbing, gained speed with skiing and currently settle down with running and toddler lifting. Sailing seems to be the next thing to get my hands on.

For a living I gather data, make it behave, model it and take care that its secrets revealed appeal to the observers eyes. My tool set is heavily R-centric but involves everything that comes handy in getting the job done and that can - in a wide sense - be interfaced or combined with R - GTK+ via gwidgets for user interface handling, HTML and Javascript for data presentation, SQL for data storage, C++ for performance or PHP for server scripting.

Although, holding Bachelor as well as Master in Politics and Management my true love for the last 6 years have been models, graphs and all kinds of data. If you are interested in a high diversity of data, methods and techniques do politics. We have them all: cross section and time series, panel and multi level, causal and predictive, survival and sequences, text and web, frequentist and baysian, simulation and experiment ... next year big and high performance will join the club accompanied by machine learning.
