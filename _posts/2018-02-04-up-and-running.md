Finally, I finished my search for a new framework to handle my personal webpage. 
You know something that would not involve too much semi-automatic pasting content
into placeholders while all the time having it look like some second hand page 
from the late two-thousands. 

I found it and I am happy so far: A Jekyll page with a simple but solid and 
elegant design by [Niklas Buschmann](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast).
